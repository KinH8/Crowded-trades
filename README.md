# Crowded-trades
We measure sector crowdedness in the Malaysian equity market using eigenvector centrality along with relative value as a cross check

According to Kinlaw, Kritzman and Turkington (2019) Crowded Trades: Implications for Sector Rotation and Factor Timing, eigenvector centrality locates crowded trading. Intuitively an investor could profit from entering a bubble run-up (rather than at the late bubble cycle); for this purpose we time our exposure to crowded sectors using relative value. The trade involves buying crowded and non-overvalued stocks; and selling crowded and overvalued stocks.

Our analysis is done on sectors in the Malaysian equities market. Figure below shows the heat map of sector centrality, where darker colors correspond to higher centrality score. The scores are consistent with market run-ups in tech, plantation, energy and healthcare sectors.

Here we included the centrality score and normalized price-to-book of the tech sector. The sector appears crowded still but the valuation appears undemanding. In this instance it may be useful to condition entry on positive return or uptrend.
